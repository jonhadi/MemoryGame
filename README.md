A memory testing game utilizing react to update gamestate 
Go here to test: https://bit.ly/35j7QLb
```
The game keeps state of score and highscore
Once you click on a character, their ID is remembered in an array
Each time you click you are checked against the array
If you're current score is higher than your score you update
```
Game is themed to my favorite cartoon
